"Data management tools built into GeoNode allow for integrated creation of "
"data, documents, link to external documents, and map visualizations. Each "
"dataset in the system can be shared publicly or restricted to allow access "
"to only specific users. Social features like user profiles and commenting "
"and rating systems allow for the development of communities around each "
"platform to facilitate the use, management, and quality control of the data "
"the GeoNode instance contains."
