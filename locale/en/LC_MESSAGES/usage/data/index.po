"Data management tools built into GeoNode allow for integrated creation of"
" data, documents, link to external documents, and map visualizations. "
"Each dataset in the system can be shared publicly or restricted to allow "
"access to only specific users. Social features like user profiles and "
"commenting and rating systems allow for the development of communities "
"around each platform to facilitate the use, management, and quality "
"control of the data the GeoNode instance contains."
