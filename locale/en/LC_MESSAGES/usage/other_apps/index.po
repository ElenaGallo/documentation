"Your GeoNode project is based on core components which are interoperable "
"and as such, it is straightforward for you to integrate with external "
"applications and services. This section will walk you through how to "
"connect to your GeoNode instance from other applications and how to "
"integrate other services into your GeoNode project. When complete, you "
"should have a good idea about the possibilities for integration, and have"
" basic knowledge about how to accomplish it. You may find it necessary to"
" dive deeper into how to do more complex integration in order to "
"accomplish your goals, but you should feel comfortable with the basics, "
"and feel confident reaching out to the wider GeoNode community for help."
